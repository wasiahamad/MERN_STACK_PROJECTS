You are a senior full-stack MERN developer and WebRTC expert.

Build a Zoom-like real-time video conferencing web application using the MERN stack with modern, clean, professional UI/UX.

TECH STACK:
- Frontend: React.js (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB with Mongoose
- Real-time: WebRTC + Socket.IO
- Authentication: JWT (access + refresh tokens)
- Media: WebRTC (getUserMedia, RTCPeerConnection)
- Deployment ready architecture

CORE FEATURES (MUST IMPLEMENT):

1. Authentication & User Management
- User Signup/Login using Email or Mobile Number
- JWT-based authentication
- User profile (name, email, avatar)
- Protected routes

2. Meeting / Room System
- Create Meeting (Generate unique room ID)
- Join Meeting using Room ID
- Show participant list in real time
- Leave meeting functionality
- Host and participant roles

3. Video Conferencing (WebRTC)
- Real-time video & audio calling using WebRTC
- Mute / Unmute microphone
- Camera On / Off
- Switch camera & microphone
- Screen sharing (optional but preferred)
- Handle user join/leave smoothly
- Peer-to-peer connection with signaling via Socket.IO

4. Chat System
- In-meeting real-time chat
- Sender/receiver message UI
- Auto-scroll and timestamps

5. Modern UI / UX (VERY IMPORTANT)
- Zoom-like dashboard layout
- Clean dark/light theme
- Responsive for desktop & mobile
- Video grid layout (dynamic based on participants)
- Smooth animations using Framer Motion
- Professional buttons, icons, and spacing
- Toast notifications for join/leave, errors

6. Dashboard
- User dashboard after login
- Create new meeting button
- Join meeting input
- Show previous meetings (stored in DB)

7. Backend APIs
- Auth APIs (register, login, refresh token)
- Meeting APIs (create, join, history)
- Socket.IO signaling server
- Proper folder structure (MVC pattern)

8. Database Models
- User model
- Meeting model (host, participants, timestamps)
- Message model (optional)

9. Code Quality
- Clean, modular, readable code
- Proper comments
- Environment variables usage
- Error handling & validation

10. Extra (Bonus)
- Waiting room before joining meeting
- Copy meeting link button
- Network error handling
- Media permission handling UI

DELIVERABLE:
- Full frontend + backend code
- Clear folder structure
- Ready to run on Replit
- Include README with setup steps

IMPORTANT:
- Use WebRTC correctly (offer, answer, ICE candidates)
- Use Socket.IO ONLY for signaling (not media streaming)
- UI must feel like a modern Zoom / Google Meet clone
- Do not skip UI/UX polish

Start by generating:
1. Project folder structure
2. Backend code
3. Frontend code
4. WebRTC + Socket.IO logic
5. Final integration
